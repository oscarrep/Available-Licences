# Available Licences

Video game licensing is an essential step to a successful manufacturing, distribution and selling of a videogame. Copyrights are an important first step of the licensing process as it gives you legal ownership to your game. As owner of the game you can initiate licensing contracts to distribute and sell your work. Licenses are executed in compliance with various laws and ensure that the developer’s rights and interests are well protected. Both big video game companies and indie developers need to protect their intellectual property to prevent misuse of their product.

## What is copyright?

A [copyright](https://copyrightalliance.org/ca_faq_post/what-is-copyright/) is a collection of rights that is automatically granted to someone who creates an original author's work, such as a literary work, a song, a movie or some kind of software. These rights include the right to reproduce the work, prepare derivative works, distribute copies and perform and display the work to the public.

There are three requirements a work must meet in order to be protected by copyright:
- **Originality:** a work can’t be a copy of another's work. There is no need for it to be novel, unique, imaginative or inventive.
- **Creativity:** a work has to demonstrate a small amount of creativity.
- **Fixed:** a work needs to be fixed in a tangible medium of expression.

Copyright law covers the "form of material expression," not the actual concepts, ideas, techniques, or facts in a particular work. So a work must be fixed in a tangible form in order to receive protection from copyright.

Copyrighted works are usually protected for the duration of the author’s life plus another 70 years, for collaborative works this protection is applied for the duration of the last living member’s life plus 70 years. Anonymous works, as well as pseudonymous works and works made for hire are protected for 95 years starting from the year of first publication or 120 years from its creation, whichever expires first.

### Fair use

Rights granted to copyright owners are limited. Under specific circumstances, anyone can use a work without getting the copyright owner’s permission or paying to use it. As long as this usage stays within the limits of fair use.
Fair use is a defense against a claim of copyright infringement. Any copying of a copyrighted material done for a transformative purpose, such as commentary, criticism, parody, education or research could be qualified as fair use.

## And trademark?

According to the [United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-getting-started/trademark-basics/trademark-patent-or-copyright), a **trademark** is a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others. A **service mark** is a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than goods. Some examples include brand names, slogans, and logos. The term "trademark" is often used in a general sense to refer to both trademarks and service marks.
