# What is licensing?

Licensing is an essential step to a successful manufacturing, distribution and selling of a videogame. Copyrights are an important first step of the licensing process as it gives you legal ownership to your game. As owner of the game you can initiate licensing contracts to distribute and sell your work. Licenses are executed in compliance with various laws and ensure that the developer’s rights and interests are well protected. Both big video game companies and indie developers need to protect their intellectual property to prevent misuse of their product.

## What is copyright?

A [copyright](https://copyrightalliance.org/ca_faq_post/what-is-copyright/) is a collection of rights that is automatically granted to someone who creates an original author's work, such as a literary work, a song, a movie or some kind of software. These rights include the right to reproduce the work, prepare derivative works, distribute copies and perform and display the work to the public.

There are three requirements a work must meet in order to be protected by copyright:
- **Originality:** a work can’t be a copy of another's work. There is no need for it to be novel, unique, imaginative or inventive.
- **Creativity:** a work has to demonstrate a small amount of creativity.
- **Fixed:** a work needs to be fixed in a tangible medium of expression.

Copyright law covers the "form of material expression," not the actual concepts, ideas, techniques, or facts in a particular work. So a work must be fixed in a tangible form in order to receive protection from copyright.

Copyrighted works are usually protected for the duration of the author’s life plus another 70 years, for collaborative works this protection is applied for the duration of the last living member’s life plus 70 years. Anonymous works, as well as pseudonymous works and works made for hire are protected for 95 years starting from the year of first publication or 120 years from its creation, whichever expires first.

### Fair use

Rights granted to copyright owners are limited. Under specific circumstances, anyone can use a work without getting the copyright owner’s permission or paying to use it. As long as this usage stays within the limits of fair use.
Fair use is a defense against a claim of copyright infringement. Any copying of a copyrighted material done for a transformative purpose, such as commentary, criticism, parody, education or research could be qualified as fair use.

### Copyright vs. patent 

Patents are the opposite of copyright, where copyright protects tangible mediums of expressions and offers a relatively weak protection for a long period of time, patents protect the ideas themselves and provide a very strong protection for a relatively short period of time. 

Patents are awarded to new inventions and non-obvious improvements, which would include lots of things that can save development time. They also allow the owner to keep others from making, using, selling, exporting or importing components to be assembled into an infringing device. This protection usually lasts for 20 years from the moment of filing.

To obtain a patent the creator must fill a claim explaining what the invention does and how it works. It‘s an extremely long, complex and expensive process to go through, so it is highly recommended to hire a patent attorney.

## And trademark?

According to the [United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-getting-started/trademark-basics/trademark-patent-or-copyright), a **trademark** is a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others. A **service mark** is a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than goods. Some examples include brand names, slogans, and logos. The term "trademark" is often used in a general sense to refer to both trademarks and service marks.

Trademarks don’t expire after a number of years like copyrights do. Trademark rights come from use, meaning a trademark could last forever as long as it’s being used.

A trademark not only gives the owner exclusive right to use the mark but also allows them to prevent others from using any similar mark that could be confusing for the public. It doesn’t prevent others from making and or selling the same services or goods under a clearly different mark.

If someone wants to claim the rights of a particular mark, they can use ™ for trademark and ℠ for service mark. The ® symbol means federal registration and can only be used after the USPTO registers the mark. The ® symbol can only be used with goods and/or services that were listed in the federal trademark application.

## Licencing IPs

Do your research. When developing software, the first thing one needs to do is making sure no one else already owns the rights to it. This is a rather complex issue, so most experts recommend hiring a patent attorney to do a full patent research.

## Free software licenses

Here is a list of some open source software licenses and a bit of comparison between them. They are already available on GitHub so there is no need to look for them anywhere else.

### Apache License 2.0 
###### ```apache-2.0```
A permissive license whose main conditions require preservation of copyright and license notices. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code.
### GNU General Public License v3.0 
###### ```gpl-3.0```
Permissions of this strong copyleft license are conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license. Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights.
### MIT License
###### ```mit```
A short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code.
### BSD 2-Clause “Simplified” License
###### ```bsd-2-clause```
A permissive license that comes in two variants, the BSD 2-Clause and BSD 3-Clause. Both have very minute differences to the MIT license.
### BSD 3-Clause “New” or “Revised” License
###### ```bsd-3-clause```
A permissive license similar to the BSD 2-Clause License, but with a 3rd clause that prohibits others from using the name of the project or its contributors to promote derived products without written consent.
### Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal
###### ```cc0-1.0```
The Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication waives copyright interest in a work you've created and dedicates it to the world-wide public domain. Use CC0 to opt out of copyright entirely and ensure your work has the widest reach. As with the Unlicense and typical software licenses, CC0 disclaims warranties. CC0 is very similar to the Unlicense.
### Eclipse Public License 2.0
###### ```epl-1.0```
This commercially-friendly copyleft license provides the ability to commercially license binaries; a modern royalty-free patent license grant; and the ability for linked works to use other licenses, including commercial ones.
### GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
###### ```agpl-3.0```
Permissions of this strongest copyleft license are conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license. Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. When a modified version is used to provide a service over a network, the complete source code of the modified version must be made available.
### GNU General Public License v2.0
###### ```gpl-2.0```
The GNU GPL is the most widely used free software license and has a strong copyleft requirement. When distributing derived works, the source code of the work must be made available under the same license. There are multiple variants of the GNU GPL, each with different requirements.
### GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1
###### ```lgpl-2.1```
Primarily used for software libraries, the GNU LGPL requires that derived works be licensed under the same license, but works that only link to it do not fall under this restriction. There are two commonly used versions of the GNU LGPL.
### GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0
###### ```lgpl-3.0```
Permissions of this copyleft license are conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications under the same license or the GNU GPLv3. Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. However, a larger work using the licensed work through interfaces provided by the licensed work may be distributed under different terms and without source code for the larger work.
### Mozilla Public License 2.0
###### ```mpl-2.0```
Permissions of this weak copyleft license are conditioned on making available source code of licensed files and modifications of those files under the same license (or in certain cases, one of the GNU licenses). Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. However, a larger work using the licensed work may be distributed under different terms and without source code for files added in the larger work.
### The Unlicense
###### ```unlicense```
A license with no conditions whatsoever which dedicates works to the public domain. Unlicensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code.
