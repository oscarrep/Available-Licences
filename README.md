# Available Licences

Video game licensing is an essential step to a successful manufacturing, distribution and selling of a videogame. Copyrights are an important first step of the licensing process as it gives you legal ownership to your game. As owner of the game you can initiate licensing contracts to distribute and sell your work. Licenses are executed in compliance with various laws and ensure that the developer’s rights and interests are well protected. Both big video game companies and indie developers need to protect their intellectual property to prevent misuse of their product.
