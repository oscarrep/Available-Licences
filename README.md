# Available Licences

Video game licensing is an essential step to a successful manufacturing, distribution and selling of a videogame. Copyrights are an important first step of the licensing process as it gives you legal ownership to your game. As owner of the game you can initiate licensing contracts to distribute and sell your work. Licenses are executed in compliance with various laws and ensure that the developer’s rights and interests are well protected. Both big video game companies and indie developers need to protect their intellectual property to prevent misuse of their product.

## What is copyright?

A [copyright](https://copyrightalliance.org/ca_faq_post/what-is-copyright/) is a collection of rights that is automatically granted to someone who creates an original author's work, such as a literary work, a song, a movie or some kind of software. These rights include the right to reproduce the work, prepare derivative works, distribute copies and perform and display the work to the public.

There are three requirements a work must meet in order to be protected by copyright:
- **Originality:** a work can’t be a copy of another's work. There is no need for it to be novel, unique, imaginative or inventive.
- **Creativity:** a work has to demonstrate a small amount of creativity.
- **Fixed:** a work needs to be fixed in a tangible medium of expression.
